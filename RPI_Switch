Introduction:
This is a continuation of the access point tutorial for Raspberry Pi.  
The purpose of this tutorial is for the reader to learn how to set up a bridge for two devices to allow traffic in and out of the internet.

Getting Started:
We will need a Raspberry Pi 3 B acting as an access point, a Raspberry Pi 3 B with Raspbian OS to act as traffic to and from the internet, 
and an ethernet cable for bridge connection.  We will be altering the Raspberry Pi 3 B we used as an access point.

1.	Installation
2.	Add Interface Bridge
3.	Configure Bridge
4.	Restart System Network
5.	Alter HOSTAPD Configuration
6.	Check Network Interfaces
7.	Connect RPi to Internet

1.	Installation
  a)	Install bridge utilities:
    >> sudo apt install hostapd bridge-utils
  b)	Stop the new software off since the configurations are not ready
    >> sudo systemctl stop hostapd
2.	Add Interface 
  a)	Open dhcpcd configuration file
    >> sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
  b)	Add two interfaces above added “interfaces” lines
    >> denyinterfaces wlan0
    >> denyinterfaces eth0
  c)	Add a new bridge
    >> sudo brctl addbr br0
  d)	Connect the network ports (eth0 and br0)
    >> sudo brctl addif br0 eth0
3.	Configure Bridge
  a)	Create a bridge configuration
    >> sudo nano /etc/system/network/bridge-br0.netdev
  b)	Type the following into the file:
    [NetDev]
    Name=br0
    Kind=bridge
  c)	Configure the bridge slave eth0 interface
    >> sudo nano /etc/system/network/bridge-br0-slave.network
  d)	Type the following:
    [Match]
    Name=eth0

    [Network]
    Bridge=br0
  e)	Configure the bridge br0 interface
    >> sudo nano /etc/system/network/bridge-br0.network
  f)	Type the following:
    [Match]
    Name=br0

    [Network]
    Address=192.168.10.100/24
    Gateway=192.168.10.1
    DNS=8.8.8.8

4.	Restart System Network
  a)	Restart the System Network for the changes to take place in the configuration files.
    >> sudo systemctl restart systemd-netowrkd
5.	Alter HOSTAPD Configuration
  a)	Look for interface=wlan0 under hostapd.conf and under it, add bridge=br0.
    >> sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd/conf

    interface=wlan0
    bridge=br0	#Add this line between interface and driver

  b)	Reboot Raspberry Pi
    >> sudo reboot

  c)	Start hostapd
    >> sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
    >> sudo systemctl enable hostapd
    >> sudo systemctl start hostapd
6.	Check Network Interfaces
  a)	Check to see that wlan0 and eth0 have no IP address as they are being controlled by the bridge (br0).
    >> ip addr
7.	Connect RPi to Internet
  a)	On the “router” RPi, connect to the internet.  The tutorial “Setting Up VNC” has the information on how to connect.
  b)	Plug in the ethernet cable via RJ45 of both Raspberry PIs and test the connection.
