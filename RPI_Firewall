Introduction:
This is an optional continuation of the access point tutorial for Raspberry Pi.  
The purpose of this tutorial is for the reader to learn how to secure their network from potential attacks from the outside.

Getting Started:
We will need a third Raspberry Pi to act as our Firewall.  
This connection comes in between the Router device and Access Point device.

1.	Installation – Persistent IP Tables make it easier to load and save iptables settings.
2.	Set Basic Rules to Iptables – This step is about adding basic rules for in and outbound traffic

1.	Installation
  >> sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent
  >> sudo nano /etc/iptables.test.rules
  >> sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.test.rules
  >> sudo iptables -L
  >> sudo sh -c ‘iptables-save > /etc/iptables.up.rules’

Edit file:
  >> sudo nano /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/iptables

    #!/bin/sh
    /sbin/iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.up.rules

  Save file

  >> sudo chmod +x /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/iptables

2.	Set basic rules to iptables
  #Allow Loopback traffic
  -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
  -A INPUT ! -i lo -d 127.0.0.0/8 -REJECT

  #Accept all ESTABLISHED inbound connections
  -A INPUT -m state –state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

  #Allow all outbound traffic, you can also set rules for outbound traffic to malicious websites
  -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT

  #Allows HTTP and HTTPS connections, currently disabled
  #-A INPUT -p tcp –dport 80 -j ACCEPT
  #-A INPUT -p tcp –dport 443 -j ACCEPT

  #Allow SSH connections
  -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

  #Allows VNC connections from anywhere
  -A INPUT -p tcp -m state –state NEW –dport 5901 -j ACCEPT

  #Reject ping from outside the network
  -A INPUT -p icmp -m icmp –icmp-type 8 -j REJECT

  #Reject any other inbound connection
  -A INPUT -j DROP
  -A FORWARD -j DROP

  COMMIT

3.	Save and load rules
  >> sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.test.rules
  >> sudo iptables -L
  >> sudo sh -c ‘iptables-save > /etc/iptables.up.rules’
