# RPI_Network
This repo outlines the steps to creating an independent wLAN/LAN using at least two Raspberry PIs.

The tutorials will follow two major steps: Creating a wireless access point and a switch.
As a bonus, this tutorial includes a simple firewall that can be placed in between the two nodes.
